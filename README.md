# Wolfram Mathematica Notebooks for Physics

This repository contains a collection of **Wolfram Mathematica notebooks** designed to help users learn and explore **fundamental physics** through symbolic computation and visualization.

The notebooks emphasize **symbolic solutions** wherever possible, along with clear and interactive **visualizations** to build conceptual understanding. These resources are ideal for students, educators, or self-learners who wish to strengthen their understanding of physics using a computational approach.
